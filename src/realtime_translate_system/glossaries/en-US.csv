Type,Proper Noun ,Description
Fab,DDR Ratio,The Defective Dies Ratio is an indicator of wafer defects and serves as a benchmark to determine whether a batch of products will be scrapped. These defects affect the product yield.
Fab,EC,"These are the machine's set values; some can be adjusted based on different process tuning parameters. According to process definitions, certain values, like machine temperature, are fixed and cannot be changed. Before returning the machine, ensure the EC matches the master version."
Fab,ECS,"Equipment Constant System: Prevents the risk of product scrapping due to changes in machine parameters, similar to an equipment engineer's RMS."
Fab,ECCP,Engineering Change Certification Plan
Fab,ECN,Engineer Change Notice.
Fab,Emergency stop,Emergency Stop.
Fab,Alignment mark,"A reference mark on the machine is used as a baseline, typically selecting a specific (asymmetric, non-repetitive) position on the wafer. This allows the machine to automatically capture it as a reference point."
Fab,ALP,"Active Load Port (ALP): When both machine ports are filled, a third batch is sent to the ALP next to the machine. Once the machine ports are cleared, the ALP uses its arm to transfer the batch onto the machine."
Fab,STB,Start to Build: Wafer is offline.
